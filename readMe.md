Parallax scrolling effect is a technique where the background of a website scrolls at a slower pace than the foreground. The purpose is to achieve an illusion of depth within the 2d scene of a website.

plan, take one image with mountains, cut out the sky from behind the mountains and now have two images, then make the text scroll behind the mountains
